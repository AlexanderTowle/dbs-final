Hello user,
This manual serves to instruct the user on how to navigate around specific interfaces for Walmartâ€™s database.

Instructions for the database administrator interface:

Instructions for the markets interface (to run OLAP queries):

Instructions for the customer interface: The customer interface file is called final_customer_interface.py. Upon running, a user will be prompted in the terminal to enter the location of the store they would like to shop at. A query will be made to display all products available at that store, along with their id and the price. Upon typing checkout, the products in the card will be deleted from the inventory table, the total price will be calculated, and the user will be prompted for their card information. Once entered, the transaction table will be updated and the user will be asked if they have a customer id with Walmart. If the user says no, they will be entered in the database as an anonymous customer. If the user says yes, they will be prompted for it and once entered a query is made to find their name and whether or not they are a member. If they are a member, a query will be made to find their point balance as well. A customer gets a point for every $5 they spend, and the points they earn from the current purchase are added to the total and updated in the database. Then the purchased table is updated with the transaction.

Instructions for the vendor interface: The vendor interface is a file called restocker.py, and is less of an interface and more of a program meant to run in the background at all times. Upon running, it connects to the database and constantly monitors the current time. As it is now, it is set to restock at midnight since this is part of our business rules, but this can be changed by altering the if statement on line 16 and setting it to the desired hour and minute. Upon the desired time being reached, it will query to find which store locations have product UPCs that are below the restock value for that store. Then new products of that type will be added to that store according to the quantity_ordered value for that store. The sells_to table is also updated with the date of the most recent restock.
